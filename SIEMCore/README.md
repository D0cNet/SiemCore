# C# SIEM Core - Next-Generation Security Information and Event Management

A comprehensive SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system built with C# and .NET 8, designed to address the deficiencies of existing SIEM solutions in the market.

## üöÄ Features

- **Intelligent Threat Detection**: Multi-layered detection combining machine learning, behavioral analytics, and threat intelligence
- **Real-time Event Processing**: High-performance event ingestion and correlation engine
- **Advanced Analytics**: Built-in UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics) and anomaly detection
- **Integrated SOAR**: Native security orchestration, automation, and response capabilities
- **Modern Web UI**: Intuitive, responsive interface with natural language query support
- **Open Architecture**: Extensible plugin system with comprehensive REST APIs
- **Cloud-Native**: Microservices-based architecture with horizontal scaling
- **Comprehensive Alerting**: Multi-channel notifications with intelligent deduplication

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Data Collection Layer**: Ingests logs from various sources (Syslog, Windows Events, APIs)
- **Event Processing Engine**: Normalizes, enriches, and correlates security events
- **Analytics Layer**: Machine learning models for threat detection and behavioral analysis
- **Alert Management**: Intelligent alert generation and lifecycle management
- **User Interface**: Modern web-based dashboard and investigation tools

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core 8.0, C#
- **Storage**: In-memory stores (production would use Elasticsearch/SQL Server)
- **Machine Learning**: ML.NET integration
- **API**: RESTful APIs with Swagger documentation
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication (ready for integration)

## üìã Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code (optional)
- Git

## üìñ API Documentation

### Event Ingestion
```http
POST /api/siem/events
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T12:00:00Z",
  "sourceSystem": "Windows Server",
  "eventType": "Authentication",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "description": "User login attempt",
  "sourceIp": "192.168.1.100",
  "username": "john.doe",
  "rawLog": "Event log data..."
}
```

### Query Events
```http
GET /api/siem/events?startTime=2025-10-10T00:00:00Z&severity=High&page=1&pageSize=50
```

### Get Alerts
```http
GET /api/siem/alerts?status=Open&severity=Critical
```

### Update Alert Status
```http
PUT /api/siem/alerts/{alertId}/status
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "Resolved",
  "resolution": "False positive - legitimate admin activity"
}
```

## üîß Configuration

The system includes several configurable services:

### Data Sources
Configure various log sources through the DataSource model:
- Syslog servers
- Windows Event Logs
- Database audit logs
- Custom APIs

### Correlation Rules
Create custom threat detection rules:
- Time-based correlation
- Pattern matching
- Machine learning models
- Threshold-based alerting

### Notification Channels
Configure alert notifications:
- Email notifications
- Slack integration
- SMS alerts
- Webhook endpoints

## üß™ Testing

### Sample Event Ingestion
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/siem/events" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "timestamp": "2025-10-10T12:00:00Z",
    "sourceSystem": "Test System",
    "eventType": "Security",
    "severity": "High",
    "description": "Suspicious activity detected",
    "sourceIp": "192.168.1.100",
    "username": "testuser"
  }'
```

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

## üìä Dashboard Statistics
Access real-time SIEM statistics:
```http
GET /api/siem/dashboard/stats
```

Returns:
- Total events processed
- Recent event counts
- Severity distribution
- Top event sources
- System health metrics

## üîí Security Features

- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Real-time threat indicator checking
- **Behavioral Analytics**: User and entity behavior monitoring
- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning-based anomaly scoring
- **False Positive Reduction**: Adaptive learning from analyst feedback
- **Automated Response**: Configurable response playbooks

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider:

1. **Database Integration**: Replace in-memory stores with Elasticsearch and SQL Server
2. **Message Queue**: Implement RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka for event streaming
3. **Load Balancing**: Deploy multiple API instances behind a load balancer
4. **Monitoring**: Integrate with Application Insights or similar monitoring solutions
5. **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
6. **Scaling**: Deploy on Kubernetes for automatic scaling
